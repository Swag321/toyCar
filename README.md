# toyCar
Made a toy car out of an arduino nano, sound sensor, motors, batteries, etc. 
Turns right when clapped twice, left when clapped three times, and reverse when clapped four times times. 

# Logistics
Timer activates when sound sensor detects a loud spike in noise from a clap.
If another intense volume is detected within a predefined time duration then timer is reset to detect more potential claps. 

Two H-bridge L298N Motor Drive is connected to two motors each. The motors rotate clockwise and counterclockwise to turn the car back and forth.
One motor rotates while the other doesnâ€™t in order to pivot the car left/right across the motionless wheel.
